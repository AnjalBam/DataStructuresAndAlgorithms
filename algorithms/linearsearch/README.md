# *Linear Search*
<p>This is a very simple type of searching algorithm.</p>
The simple approach to do the linear search is: 

##### Algorithm
<ol>
    <li>Starting from the leftmost element in an array</li>
    <li>Traverse through each and every element in an array</li>
    <li>Compare the element to search with every element and return the element if match found.</li>
</ol>

> Note: The traversing can be any way from left to right or vice versa.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity is very high in this case and is not considered good searching algorithm for large arrays. The 
Big-O notation for the algorithm is O(n).
